# Good Luck API

_Read in other languages: English, [Portugu√™s(Brasil)](./README.md)_

API for generating and registering betting tickets without registering personal data.

## üìã How will it be

An API will be developed using NextJS and MongoDB

Project base:

[NextJS Typescript Boilerplate](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/master/examples/with-typescript-eslint-jest)

> Bootstrap a developer-friendly NextJS app configured with:
>
> - [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
> - Linting with [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)
> - Formatting with [Prettier](https://prettier.io/)
> - Linting, typechecking and formatting on by default using [`husky`](https://github.com/typicode/husky) for commit hooks
> - Testing with [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) and [`react-testing-library`](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro)

The generator should generate a random number and check if the registered number already exists or is in temporary reserve, if not, make a temporary reserve (certain seconds) and return to the user.

If the number is chosen, register it linked to a unique secret key that will be used to validate ticket ownership.

If you are asked to generate a new number, delete the temporary record and call the new number generation function.

If temporary registration time expires, call new number generation function.

Temporary booking time must be returned to the user.
